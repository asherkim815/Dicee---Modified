This project came from a Udemy course by Angela Yu, The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.

I modified it the following way:

1. Replaced page-reload with the "Roll" button and keyup eventlistener for rolling dices
2. Added "document.activeElement.blur();" to unfocus after clicking on the button, to prevent the space bar from clicking
3. Applied flexbox column-direction
4. Modified texts
